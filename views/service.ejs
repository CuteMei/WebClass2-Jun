            <h6><b><u>Consultation:</u></b></h6>
            <p>In traditional Chinese medicine, the purpose of consultation is to understand 
                the patient's daily life and diet in order to determine the Yin and Yang attributes 
                of the patient's constitution.</p>
            <h6><b><u>Acupuncture:</u></b></h6>
            <p>Acupuncture: Through observation, listening, questioning, and palpation, we determine 
                whether the body's Qi and blood are normal. We find the root cause of the dysfunction of 
                the internal organs, and use specific needles at specific acupoints with specific techniques 
                to perform acupuncture, thereby regulating the function of the internal organs, promoting 
                the circulation of Qi and blood, and maintaining the body's Yin-Yang balance.</p>
            <h6><b><u>Tui Na (Chinese Massage):</u></b></h6>
            <p>This is a method of treatment in Traditional Chinese Medicine. It involves using the hands 
                or forearms to apply pressure along the meridians or acupoints to unblock the meridians, 
                promote blood circulation, and improve the function of the internal organs.</p>
            <h6><b><u>Cupping:</u></b></h6>
            <p>This involves using specific cups that adhere to acupoints or are pushed and pulled along 
                meridians to draw out toxins, dampness, and cold from the body. Cupping can draw out toxins 
                from deeper layers of the body.</p>
            <h6><b><u>Gua sha:</u></b></h6>
            <p>This is a therapy that uses a special scraping tool to remove toxins from the body's surface.</p>
